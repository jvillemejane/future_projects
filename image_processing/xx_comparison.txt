Comparison between C++/Python and OpenCV
########################################

All the tests were realized with a MSI GT63 Titan 9DF including Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2592Â MHz, 6 cores, 32 Gb of RAM DDR4 2666 MHz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX2070 8 Gb GDDR6.

The images used during these tests are :
- robot.pgm
- black_white.pgm

Tests were executed 10 times and the average value is given.

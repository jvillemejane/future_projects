01_images
=========
	
Start by discovering PGM images (without compression - grayscale)

* :file:`01_imagePGM_class` : a class that describes a PGM image and its content, with:
	* :code:`readImagePGM` method to read an image from its file name 
	* overloading of the << operator
* :file:`02_imagePGM_modular` : the same as previously but with:
	* separated files for class declaration, definition and main program
	* :code:`writeImagePGM` method to write an image
* :file:`03_imagePGM_rotate` : the same as previously but with:
	* :code:`rotateImagePGM` method to rotate an image of 90°
	* execution time of rotation and reading file

To do ?
* PPM images in RGB


02_convolution and morphologic transforms
=========================================

* :file:`04_imagePGM_first_convolution` : introducing the convolution with a kernel. Kernel class.
* :file:`05_imagePGM_dilate_erode` : introducing the dilatation and erosion transforms.
* :file:`06_imagePGM_opening_closing` : introducing the opening and closing transforms.

03_OPENCV ?
===========

Start by discovering PGM images (without compression - grayscale)

	* :code:`readImagePGM` method to read an image from its file name 
	* overloading of the << operator
* :file:`02_imagePGM_modular` : the same as previously but with:
	* separated files for class declaration, definition and main program
	* :code:`writeImagePGM` method to write an image
